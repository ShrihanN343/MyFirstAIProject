Inspiration: 

I was inspred to create this project because of my passion towards the world of business and computer science. I love the problem solving aspect of programming, and I decided to combine my interests and create this project. Crerating this project helped me further my skills in programming and revealed to me how the worlds of computer science and business overlap in a real-life scenario. 

Project setup description: 

This project was developed using Python3. For the purposes of data collection of stock history, the yfinance package in Python was used. In order to perform mathematical operations involving the study of stock prediction, python packages such as Numpy, Pandas, Pytorch, and ScikitLearn were used. Two additional models were included in the program in addition to the LSTM model, which were named baseline and classical (for purposes of comparison and variety of models). 

Usage: 

The model allows users to enter the ticker symbol for what stock they would like to see the forecast for. The program then generates a graph showcasing a one-month forecast on a graph that compares LSTM's predictions in comparison to the actual stock value at the given date.
